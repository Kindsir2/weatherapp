A simple Node.js + Express web application to search for weather data by city, store recent searches in a SQLite database, and display the latest results in a responsive table.

## Features

- Search for current weather by city name
- Weather data fetched from OpenWeatherMap API (API key required)
- Stores each search in a local SQLite database
- Displays the 10 most recent searches in a scrollable, responsive table
- Clean, modern, and mobile-friendly UI

## Requirements

- Node.js (v16 or higher recommended)
- npm
- [OpenWeatherMap API key](https://openweathermap.org/api)

   ```sh
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd Weather
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh

3. **Set up your OpenWeatherMap API key:**
